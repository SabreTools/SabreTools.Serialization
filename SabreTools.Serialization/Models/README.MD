# SabreTools.Data.Models

This namespace comprises of models that represent either directly serializable or representative structures for all SabreTools projects. The majority of models will have deserializers and wrappers, with some also having both regular and cross-model serializers.

## Notable Information Sources

Not all of this information was able to be gathered directly from the files in question, so here is a non-exhaustive list of sites and projects that allow this project to exist. Most of the models also have direct links to specific pages or code snippets, where available.
